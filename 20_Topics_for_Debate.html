</p><p id="8601bcca-065d-47aa-86da-fb3de1ff8da2" class="">This page lists suggested subjects that can be discussed to practice agreeing and disagreeing in English.</p><p id="c414ec0e-3f7d-44b6-9d74-5f1bdbb7a075" class="">Here are 20 topics to discuss with a friend or group. Practice agreeing and disagreeing even if you have to argue against something you actually believe in. One way to have fun with this is to make up a bunch of cards that say <em>agree</em> or <em>disagree</em>. Each person has to pick up a card and then the topic is read out. It is more fun to have a debate this way because you don&#x27;t have to play your true self. Try to continue each discussion for at least five minutes. Use the expressions that you learned, including agreeing, disagreeing, asking for opinions, interrupting, etc.</p><ol type="1" id="2e70d045-da85-473e-9a82-bd7da6101038" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="f682debd-c723-4783-b903-9fb40b8ae755" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>Swimming in the ocean is better than swimming in a public pool.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="7bbfd051-7931-4dc4-8d34-28e06e9a0718" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li>Alcohol should be illegal.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="ab703e4d-2109-4a28-9492-f33dddc3684e" class="numbered-list" start="4"><li>Children should provide room and board for their aging parents.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="00f67b00-b8c1-495e-acd0-a11f88737f76" class="numbered-list" start="5"><li>Studying grammar is more important than practicing conversation skills.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="b085ae3e-1076-4ed7-a023-4109e734b28a" class="numbered-list" start="6"><li>Television is the leading cause of violence in today&#x27;s society.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="38216dbf-b45f-4fa7-afa5-305a858e6848" class="numbered-list" start="7"><li>Dogs make better companions than cats.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="9c483644-6360-4e6c-9e7a-15feeda69fdc" class="numbered-list" start="8"><li>Smoking should be permitted in public places.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="f54d01e4-22d0-4932-a736-4f7de4d45311" class="numbered-list" start="9"><li>Females are better students than males.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="26a71232-e976-4080-ac4e-6cc6b3feec34" class="numbered-list" start="10"><li>A parent shouldn&#x27;t pierce a baby&#x27;s ears.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="56b4350e-33e8-45d7-adb7-f42a7644b4ab" class="numbered-list" start="11"><li>Women should be allowed to go topless in public.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="6ad4c149-7ea8-4a71-8264-e21f55b7c2f8" class="numbered-list" start="12"><li>Lawyers should make a higher salary than nurses.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="80aea1e7-8162-479c-a4a7-a4d48f8fc06d" class="numbered-list" start="13"><li>Everyone should plan their own funeral.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="40887708-ef5e-4f4b-9472-fda835ae2c62" class="numbered-list" start="14"><li>Reading English is more difficult than writing English.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="b35ec9f3-291a-41e0-971d-1f0edfa64756" class="numbered-list" start="15"><li>Summer is the best season of the year.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="00f77a58-0021-4bd2-a442-e5c8d832b4c9" class="numbered-list" start="16"><li>Children under 13 should not be allowed to babysit.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="ed5d3e29-ba51-4739-86c1-4740b05840c8" class="numbered-list" start="17"><li>High school students should wear uniforms.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="fc004ed2-cec0-44c4-89ca-c7a08ec9cbbf" class="numbered-list" start="18"><li>21 should be the legal driving age around the world.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="f76e5311-93b1-44bf-ac5c-98d2ad1bf9d7" class="numbered-list" start="19"><li>Rock and Roll is the best kind of music.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="fb392c0f-6a75-4600-bfc0-9bc5f7404715" class="numbered-list" start="20"><li>The government should pay for post secondary education.</li></ol></div></article></body></html>
