Offering an opinion can be difficult when it is not in your first language. You may know exactly what you want to say in your native tongue, but are unsure of how to express your views in English. You may also worry that your words will not come out properly or that you might hurt someone&#x27;s feelings by being too forward. Although it is easier to sit back and say nothing at all, you will become bored or frustrated if all you can do is nod your head yes or shake your head no, especially if you have a strong opinion about something.</p><p id="840b134e-0d86-4aa4-9964-200a9fb05c7a" class="">
</p><p id="4a1378c7-68ab-455d-89dc-a90c1cc97164" class="">The best thing to do is to learn and practice some common expressions that are used in discussions and debates. For example, there is a difference between agreeing strongly or only slightly. Study the common expressions and practice saying them before you move on to the practice exercises. After you have completed the exercises successfully, find a friend or a group that you can practice debating with. Use the suggested 20 topics, or make up topics of your own.</p><p id="9981f3ee-2360-4ac2-bf98-7a962ac519ed" class="">
