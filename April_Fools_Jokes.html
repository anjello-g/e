The convention is that an April Fool&#x27;s Joke must be perpetrated before noon on 1st April. Here are three published by EnglishClub. Many people &quot;fell&quot; for these jokes (they believed them), as you can see from the comments. Other people realized the stories were not true but enjoyed them anyway. And some people were very, very angry.</p><figure id="9161f1a4-46d3-4fbc-bd95-f02f1eb36612" class="image"><a href="April%20Fool&#x27;s%20Jokes%20d890223e45be4c92a3ed43dee0c90b99/80ce1141fd34ad9b.png"><img style="width:488px" src="April%20Fool&#x27;s%20Jokes%20d890223e45be4c92a3ed43dee0c90b99/80ce1141fd34ad9b.png"/></a></figure><blockquote id="630a4c01-a11a-4fe3-ad02-95fc1bf6b263" class=""><em><strong>A laugh a day keeps the doctor away!</strong></em></blockquote><p id="94cb6586-a8d1-4061-b877-532f13b4b8fe" class="">
