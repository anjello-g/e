Informal speaking situations include speaking with close friends, family workers and probably co-workers. Slang, idiom and relaxed pronunciation are more common in these situations. Small talk becomes less necessary when you are speaking with friends, but is considered polite in an informal situation with acquaintances.  Sometimes your pace and volume shifts when you feel more comfortable. Formal situations require a different kind of language. Your speaking may even be rehearsed in some situations. You may feel nervous about saying everything properly. You must also consider manners and body language.</p><p id="f8fb9393-3c3d-4552-86d1-7d0de3986fad" class="">
