People sometimes describe grammar as the &quot;rules&quot; of a language; but in fact no language has rules*. If we use the word &quot;rules&quot;, we suggest that somebody created the rules first and then spoke the language, like a new game. But languages did not start like that. Languages started by people making sounds which evolved into words, phrases and sentences. No commonly-spoken language is fixed. All languages change over time. What we call &quot;grammar&quot; is simply a reflection of a language at a particular time.</p><p id="1059688f-24a0-47c9-ace7-ed61a00f6cb1" class="">

Very many people in the world speak their own, native language without having studied its grammar. Children start to speak before they even know the word &quot;grammar&quot;. But if you are serious about learning a foreign language, the long answer is &quot;yes, grammar can help you to learn a language more quickly and more efficiently.&quot; It&#x27;s important to think of grammar as something that can help you, like a friend. When you understand the grammar (or system) of a language, you can understand many things yourself, without having to ask a teacher or look in a book.</p><p id="db6e3b75-1700-40b4-a636-209970b8ba5c" class="">
