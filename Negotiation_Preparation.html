</p><p id="80f6567e-401c-45c7-a80c-e72e00731a56" class="">Lack of preparation in a negotiation almost always sets a person up for failure. First and foremost, each party must clearly define their own goals and objectives. Secondly, each party must anticipate the goals of the opposition. This may require doing some background research. Finally, each party must come up with various alternatives to their main objectives.</p><p id="4a5ddb25-ced1-42fd-9268-1cc103b365ef" class="">

Louis sighs and reminds Markus that they already had this discussion last year. Markus agrees, but reminds Louis of his loyalty to the company and insists that they speak again on the subject next week. Eventually Louis, who is afraid that Markus might quit on the spot, agrees to meet on Monday during the crew&#x27;s lunch-hour.

Over the weekend, Markus thinks about Monday&#x27;s meeting. Last year, he was unprepared to negotiate and ended up only getting a 50 cent/hour pay raise. This did not satisfy him, and he has continued to feel undervalued ever since. Many times, after a hard day at work, Markus has considered quitting. However, it is difficult to find work in the middle of winter. Markus has a family to support and he can&#x27;t afford to lose his job.

Markus decides to do some research on negotiating. He learns the principles behind <strong>collaborative negotiating</strong>, and decides that this is the approach he will take this time. After he has understood the concept he can ask himself the preparatory questions above. Finally, he can apply the rules of collaborative negotiating to his own case.</p><p id="8f1eca1e-7683-4bcd-b7f3-e6e4dcc574ad" class="">Here are some preparatory questions to ask yourself before beginning talks with the other party:</p><ul id="206ac951-a94c-4a46-813d-095aaa6b39b2" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">What is my main objective?</li></ul><ul id="b8fa20ef-ccd2-4370-88c7-e4335036f717" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">What are all of the alternatives I can think of?</li></ul><ul id="48da5ec9-292c-44bf-b59b-e932d97d78f1" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Why do I deserve to have my goals met?</li></ul><ul id="616cd0eb-c249-4fa6-b4a8-ef64aed241e0" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">What will my opponent&#x27;s counter proposal likely consist of?</li></ul><ul id="0bac36a5-5d88-47d0-80bc-a1193b4ce154" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">How can I respond to this counter proposal?</li></ul><ul id="b7f15ab9-6bcf-423f-a98a-ded624a94654" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">When would I like to have this issue resolved?</li></ul><ul id="350522b0-22f1-401c-a054-a3d98116ae3d" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">What is my bottom-line?</li></ul><ul id="853dc20b-3abe-4f18-93dc-0d5132c89586" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">What market research/homework do I need to do to back up my cause?</li></ul><ul id="f20995c4-4ffa-439e-8aba-9272f8aeabb8" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">What is my bargaining power compared to my opponent&#x27;s?</li></ul><ul id="854b9ce6-0174-4afc-832e-94ca7239fd50" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">What do I know about the principles of negotiating?</li></ul><h1 id="7158ee65-1902-4703-ad94-a3fe2372ec0d" class="block-color-teal_background">Markus Answers the Preparatory Questions</h1><ul id="c73b9b3f-bcd9-4d0f-86bd-7edaafaceda9" class="block-color-teal_background bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">My main objective is to be named crew foreman and to earn a salary that is competitive with other foremen in the area.</li></ul><ul id="a54dc34c-38b2-446a-9327-335662f0275f" class="block-color-teal_background bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Alternatives include looking for work elsewhere, asking for a dollar more an hour, suggesting that Louis hire someone else to take on extra duties.</li></ul><ul id="ba33e7a3-9300-4db0-8afb-d0a919f564c4" class="block-color-teal_background bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">I deserve this promotion because I have worked with Landscape Labourers for five consecutive years, and have received many compliments from satisfied clients.

Landscape Labourers lost a lot of money last year due to poor weather. There were a few weeks that we couldn&#x27;t work, but Louis had to pay us anyway because of our contracts. And, unemployment is at an all time high in our region. However, Louis just signed a contract with a new company that will mean regular work for at least the next two years. Also, the other team members rely on me, and none of them have the experience to take over my position if I quit. It will cost Louis a lot of money to train a new landscaper to do everything that I do.</li></ul><ul id="e683cf21-dd1a-451a-90ef-fd84bb81e37c" class="block-color-teal_background bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">I understand that winter is tough on this business, so I would like to have this issue resolved by spring.</li></ul><ul id="4b123b3e-1945-4a94-ba1e-dc47628b025e" class="block-color-teal_background bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">I will look into three other local landscaping businesses and inquire about the salary and benefits of its employees.

This type of win-win negotiation is often called <strong>collaborative</strong> negotiating. The opposite of collaborative negotiating is called <strong>competitive</strong> negotiating. The goal of competitive negotiating is for one party to win and the other to lose. Dishonest practices, such as lying, manipulation, intimidation, and bribery are often used in this type of negotiation.</p><p id="c8f2ce5c-7566-4fbe-89e7-6cc0fb920cbf" class="">Main Principles of Collaborative Negotiating:</p><ul id="db00f2c6-8321-42c5-a8c9-02676b61c9ab" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Resolve previous conflicts ahead of time</li></ul><ul id="94140dc2-a8b9-4293-8f6d-d970147329c6" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Deal with issues, not personalities</li></ul><ul id="a72311e0-26d4-452a-8a2b-b1fbc22ed894" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Commit to listening more than speaking: The more you know about your counterpart, the more likely you will achieve your goals.
