Small talk is a casual form of conversation that &quot;breaks the ice&quot; or fills an awkward silence between people. Even though you may feel shy using your second language, it is sometimes considered rude to say nothing. Just as there are certain times when small talk is appropriate, there are also certain topics that people often discuss during these moments.</p><p id="49e1e1f9-0dcb-414d-bd0b-f670790e6d04" class="">
