After a recent search across campus, volunteers from the U of C Environmental Watch group counted only 10 recycling bins. In comparison, the students counted 30 vending machines, the majority of which carry plastics, cans, and glass bottles. Only one paper recycling bin was found. This means that almost all of the paper that is discarded on campus, including U of C residences, is being disposed of in the regular garbage. When asked why no recycling bins for paper have been placed on campus, U of C president, James Wicker, explained that the company the university employs to pick up recycling does not currently recycle paper. When asked why another company is not used, Wicker cited university finances as an obstacle.</h3><p id="6f34b23e-374e-4e5c-99c4-fd876310275b" class=""><strong>Now listen to two students discuss the article.</strong></p><figure id="33c1a015-76f2-45b6-9b51-4779f840003e"><div class="source"><a href="https://www.englishclub.com/audio/toefl/englishclub-toefl-speaking-3.mp3">https://www.englishclub.com/audio/toefl/englishclub-toefl-speaking-3.mp3</a></div></figure><p id="eb6afa6b-3d59-4166-8241-ff8e391cb818" class=""><strong>Why does the woman approve of the article?

The obsessions are typically described by OCD sufferers as persistent thoughts or impulses that cause a great amount of stress. These differ from those stressors that the average person suffers from in daily life, such as work or financial problems, in that they are a product of the imagination. While most OCD sufferers admit to knowing that their concerns are not real, they cannot control the thoughts from recurring, and they compensate by performing certain repetitive actions. In addition to these symptoms and responses, a true OCD sufferer spends a large part of the day battling this disease. The debate continues over whether the disease should be classified as a psychological or biological disorder.</h3><p id="45625b0f-5ff0-48df-8d27-48ce54b2fa93" class=""><strong>Now listen to a talk on the same academic subject.</strong></p><figure id="30e294c1-46b0-4baa-aa2d-b379b37ec4df"><div class="source"><a href="https://www.englishclub.com/audio/toefl/englishclub-toefl-speaking-4-response-listening.mp3">https://www.englishclub.com/audio/toefl/englishclub-toefl-speaking-4-response-listening.mp3</a></div></figure><p id="7c6cdbf4-1282-4242-a198-bb73feeb993d" class=""><strong>Explain how the professor&#x27;s description of OCD expands upon the reading.</strong></p><p id="25d135c4-c279-4968-9f09-4c84c0672b34" class="">Preparation time: 30 seconds</p><p id="f8d803dd-9b3a-414f-947e-cdf1609da904" class="">Response time: 60 seconds</p><p id="6f9e51fb-710f-4841-ac6f-ea7f85c92850" class=""><strong>Listen to the sample response.</strong></p><figure id="b6a2d9b8-410d-4c30-95ef-ca6646d913cb"><div class="source"><a href="https://www.englishclub.com/audio/toefl/englishclub-toefl-speaking-4-response.mp3">https://www.englishclub.com/audio/toefl/englishclub-toefl-speaking-4-response.mp3</a></div></figure><h3 id="10713440-5fdc-4729-9c2d-59fc9f9f6466" class="block-color-teal">The reading defines obsessive compulsive disorder by touching briefly on the difference between obsessions and compulsions. While it mentions that the average stressors in daily life do not cause the obsessions of OCD sufferers, the lecture expands on this fact, giving clear examples of obsessions and compulsions. The professor claims that the disorder is not taken seriously enough because people tend to misuse the term &quot;obsessed&quot;. As in the reading, the professor points out that the obsessions for OCD sufferers are not realistic. They are more like persistent thoughts that don&#x27;t make sense. In addition, the compulsions are generally unrelated to the obsessive thoughts.</h3><h3 id="89cd0b08-8e98-4f34-ad7f-2c031c559fa6" class="block-color-red">Transcript for listening conversation question 4:</h3><h3 id="02d0bd7d-c26c-46eb-ba01-6161fa36bdd9" class="block-color-red">Professor: The terms &quot;obsessed&quot; and &quot;addicted&quot; are used so loosely these days, that one of the most serious mental diseases in America is often not taken seriously even by medical professionals. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is in fact one of the most debilitating psychological diseases, though it only affects about 4% of the population. Now, when I say debilitating, I mean, in terms of quality of life. While very few people die from the symptoms and responses to OCD, if they don&#x27;t seek any help, which most don&#x27;t, they become severely depressed and isolated. Holding down a job or maintaining social relationships are virtually impossible for many OCD sufferers. The term obsession has to be defined properly when making a proper diagnosis. A true obsession for OCD sufferers is something that is considered abnormal even by the patient himself. So, we&#x27;re not talking about a passion for golf, or a love of game shows here. To an OCD sufferer, an obsession is generally a persisting thought with no merit, such as the feeling that one is going to throw oneself into traffic. The rituals and behavior that OCD sufferers engage in, such as repetitive hand washing or excessive checking are usually unrelated to the obsessive thoughts. In other words, someone who can&#x27;t get the image of a tree falling on their house out of their mind might engage in an unrelated ritual such as flipping constantly through pages of a certain book.</h3><h1 id="948ac7b8-bffa-42bd-b8f6-4ba4e26368bd" class="">Questions 5 and 6</h1><p id="2ec7b9ee-898d-485c-b49d-644d8bb2f252" class="">In question 5 and 6 you will hear a conversation and a lecture.

An iceberg that is made mostly of snow and has plenty of air pockets appears white to the human eye. We know this is a relatively young iceberg because the ice is not too thick to reflect the light back out. In contrast an iceberg that has been around for a much longer time is made up of compressed ice with very little air. The observer of this older iceberg will see blue rather than white, because only the stronger wavelengths of light can reflect back out.</h3><h3 id="66cb4242-7e70-451d-8a98-d685f4f49001" class="block-color-red">Transcript for question 6 lecture:</h3><h3 id="02fc24e3-285a-4254-a307-cfa3ae62fb31" class="block-color-red">While most icebergs appear white like snow, some have a blue tint. Icebergs that are white are made up of snow that is filled with air pockets. As the light hits the snow, the icebergs reflect back most of the light as white light. As icebergs get older, compression occurs and the ice becomes more solid. With less air bubbles, the light cannot penetrate the surface and very little light is reflected back. To understand why they appear blue it is necessary to review the different wavelengths of light, or to simply recall the colors of a rainbow or prism. At one end of the spectrum are the weak wavelengths that appear red, and at the other end are the high energy blue ones. In a very dense iceberg the weak wavelengths of light are filtered out and only those with high energy can reflect back out.</h3><figure id="89619df8-c7be-4114-94bf-67800624d455" class="link-to-page"><a href="https://www.notion.so/TOEIC-Practice-Speaking-89619df8c7be411494bf67800624d455?pvs=21">TOEIC Practice - Speaking</a></figure><p id="d26cc2a0-261c-4a51-9a95-f3c9a6e33243" class="">
