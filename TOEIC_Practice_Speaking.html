Making your own bread at home is easy with the new Double Duty Dough Mixer by Berring. Unlike other bread machines that can be difficult to clean and store, the Double Duty Dough Mixer breaks down into five parts that can go directly into your dishwasher. This stainless steel appliance will mix dough for you in a fraction of the time it takes to knead dough by hand. The automated delay feature at the beginning of the mix cycle gives your ingredients time to reach room temperature, ensuring that your breads will rise as high as bakery bread. We guarantee that the accompanying Berring Best Breads recipe book will be a family favourite.</p><p id="1f9bcfac-f4f9-4d45-b139-b31dd4c73752" class=""><strong>Read the text out loud:</strong></p><p id="850a3e24-a4d2-446c-a0ff-6e18b1ada884" class=""><strong>Listen to the sample response:</strong></p><h1 id="e6f92039-7739-4821-879d-2352a94a0b22" class="">Question 3: Describe a Photo</h1><p id="84c07c54-5dd3-4636-b568-e83128fa1a19" class="">In question 3 you will be asked to describe a picture.

As well as bicycles there are motor vehicles on this street, so it is obviously a high traffic area. A few of the cyclists have bicycles attached to their baskets. This suggests that bicycles may be their primary source of transportation. From the architecture it appears to be a tourist or shopping district. There are two tall buildings in the distance, which is likely where the business district is located. There seems to be some confusion about direction of traffic flow. The cyclists are travelling on both sides of the centre line and are going in the same direction. The cars, on the other hand, are going two different ways.</p><p id="02bdd2d3-6ab6-4873-8f3c-89869086af80" class="">Exam nerves can cause you to make silly speaking mistakes (for example &quot;bicycles attached to their baskets&quot; rather than &quot;baskets attached to their bicycles&quot;). The examiner is more concerned about clear speech. He or she will be looking for common errors, rather than nervous mistakes that are like typos. Use your 30 seconds to plan a descriptive answer with plenty of details. Practise with background noise.</p><h1 id="a53de6b9-7c72-47d6-9322-1ee254b465eb" class="">Questions 4-6: Respond to Questions</h1><p id="7f572818-3f42-4655-bc4a-9c0c0a7d3765" class="">In these questions you will be given a scenario and asked to answer three questions.</p><p id="d18c9d14-a7b3-4416-888b-997c0b4ec2a8" class="">Preparation time: 0 seconds</p><p id="b53fe8b3-4152-4b8e-ac54-ffbd88e6a856" class="">Response time: 15 seconds for questions 4 and 5. 30 seconds for question 6.</p><p id="710776f2-598b-431e-af8c-2c5922e8bb48" class=""><strong>Example Scenario:</strong></p><p id="e0f0e22e-2908-4ddb-ae9c-7a05c5b05b0d" class="">A student training to be a teacher is applying for a job at the local library.

Or maybe I&#x27;d need a little variety. For example, I might ask if I could read to children or help out with library programs.

This applies to everything, including the weather and climate. When it is sunny for too long, people head to the shade. But, if the sun hides for a few days, people flock to the beaches when it comes out. I think extreme weather can make people miserable, though. At least when it is too cold you can stay inside or dress in layers. When it is too hot the rain doesn&#x27;t fall and crops don&#x27;t grow. People go hungry and have difficulty keeping their family comfortable. Though we may wish for heat during a cold winter, we appreciate the summer days more when they finally come. So, as I mentioned, I think balance is the key to a happy life. And, I don&#x27;t think there is any perfect climate out there.</p><p id="ddf27dc2-a0ad-4434-99d4-5ef0c294ad35" class="">
